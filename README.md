# Telelog
Keep track of everything happening on your WordPress in Telegram.

## Set up
1. Create a new Telegram bot. ([Learn more](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot))
2. Go to TeleLog admin page from your wordpress dashboard.
3. Copy your bot token from botfather and paste it in the "API Key" field.
4. If you want TeleLog to send the logs to your personal account, you can use your userid and put it in the "Chat ID" field ([Find your userid](t.me/userinfobot)), the other option is to create a channel and make your bot an admin with "Post Messages" access and enter the channel username as "Chat ID", with an atsign(@) before it, e.g: `@username`.
